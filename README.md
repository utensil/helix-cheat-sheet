# Helix Cheat Sheet

A cheat sheet for [Helix editor](https://helix-editor.com/), authored in [Typst](https://typst.app/home/).

## Status

WIP, see [here](https://github.com/utensil/helix-cheat-sheet/issues/1) for screenshot and rendered PDF.

The idea is to first work out a _mini_ version that covers essentials, then possibly a _full_ version that covers more than I need personally.

## Style choice

- 👀 **discoverable** - easy to notice or search for frequently wondered stuff
- 🎨 **consistently colorful** - use colors to distinguish concepts
- 💡 **memorable keystrokes** - try to relate keystrokes to meaning
- 🧭 **spatially intuitive** - visualize directions
- ✂️ **concise** - short words and descriptions (prefer verb, no articles for nouns)
- 🔗 **explorable** - quick mention where fit, then internally linked to elaboration
- 📦 **self-contained** - assumes less of audience

## Credits

This work is inspired by Steve Hoy's [Helix Cheat Sheet v1.1](https://github.com/stevenhoy/helix-cheat-sheet/tree/c07d3f699050a4c03e7ec5653c8baa8cbddaacff) (license: CC-BY-SA), which is possibly inspired by [this Vim cheat sheet](https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0165/4168/files/preview.png) (found on [X](https://x.com/nixcraft/status/1487774760792510464)).

I love its overall layout and many ideas, but somehow feel certain parts do not fit in my mindset, so I wish to play around with it, yet it has no source but a PDF.

I'm gradually piecing together a cheat sheet in Typst, with ideas sparked by Steve Hoy's work. I've made corrections and supplements, according to other sources and verified by interactions with Helix.

Hopefully, this is also useful for others to learn and play with.
